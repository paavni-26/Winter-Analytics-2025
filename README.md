WINTER ANALYTICS 2025
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
As an ESG consultant,our team had to analyze a dataset containing 124 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator for 217 countries. Our objective was to derive actionable insights that support global and regional efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
In the first round we had to:
>Group countries based on SDG indicator values for the years 2005 and 2015.
>Perform indicator analysis
>Predict India's ability to achieve:
a.50% of total energy requirements met through renewable sources.
b.45% reduction in carbon intensity from 2005 levels.
In the next round we had to:
>Identify and analyze a country that made significant progress on specific SDGs between 2005 and 2015 and examine the policies and strategies that led to their growth.
>Evaluate Indiaâ€™s potential to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 in light of its progress on the Panchamrit commitments made at COP26 and identify critical gaps and recommend additional measures needed to meet these ambitious targets.

OUR SOLUTION:
>First we performed EDA and did data cleaning. We filled the missing values of the sdg indicators by taking mean value for all the countries and normalized the data. We then performed K means clustering and grouped countries into 3 categories for the years 2005 and 2015.We also identified the key indicators contributing to the poor performance of the countries and with the help of linear regression predicted India's ability to achieve its targets.
>For the second round we identified China as the country with maximum progress and also identified the key indicators responsible for it. Diving deeper, we researched upon the strategies implemented by the nation. These have been incorporated in our presentation. For the next part we used ARIMA time series modelling and found out India's inability to achieve its proposed targets with the current trajectory. We then brainstormed additional measures India needs to take to meet these ambitious targets.
